## AOSP

##### Building AOSP on Mac is not officially supported. So we may not be able to build all tools.

### Step 1: Setting up File system

The default file system on macOS 10.13 and later which is called Apple File System (APFS) is case-insensitive. But to build AOSP, we need a case-sensitive file system.

##### Createed a case-sensitive file system "aosp" using Disk Utility in mackbook pro 14" 2442, before we can start downloading the code.

Need at least 130GB of space on you system in order to download the source code.

### Step 2: Downloading the source

android team has made an utility called (repo)[https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/], which helps in managing multiple repositories. We will be using this utility to download android source.

Created and base directory inside the new volume, where we want to clone all the repos required for building inside the volume we created in first step.  
‚ùØ cd /Volumes/aosp
‚ùØ mkdir source
‚ùØ cd source
Now let's initialise repo. This will create a .repo/ directory with Git repositories for the Repo source code and the manifest files which specifies where the various repositories included in the Android source.
`repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest`

Now cloning the source. Also remember to pass the -c, it will tell repo clone only master branch, else it will try to clone all the branches. Optionally you can pass the -j flag to specify number of threads for faster cloning.  
`repo sync -c -j8`  
Stuck here a whole night
